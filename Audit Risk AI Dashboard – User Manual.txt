(For Students, Auditors, Supply Chain Managers - Code file Attached)

1. What Is This Tool?
Predicts if an audit is HIGH or LOW risk using AI.

Input: Financial & operational data
Output: Risk score + probability
Accuracy: 99%+ on real audit data
Use Case: Flag fake invoices, fraud, or warehouse anomalies

2. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PYTHON CODE TO WORK:
streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
joblib

3. How to Use the Dashboard
Section 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Chart,What It Shows
Risk Distribution,% of high vs low risk audits
Correlation Heatmap,Which factors drive risk?
Top Risky Locations,Locations with highest fraud
Section 2: Predict New Audit Risk
Input Sliders (Adjust These)
Section 2: Predict New Audit Risk

Slider,Meaning,Typical Range
Sector Score,Industry risk level,1–60
PARA_A,Material misstatement A,0–100
PARA_B,Material misstatement B,0–100
Money Value,Transaction size,0–1000+
History,Past audit issues,0–10
District Loss,Regional risk,0–10
PROB,Sampling probability,0.2–0.6
Control Risk,Internal controls,0.4–2.0
Inherent Risk,Natural risk,0–200



4. Example Use Case (Supply Chain)


Your Data,Map to Slider
"Order_Value = $15,000",→ Money Value
Supplier_Delayed = 5 days,→ History
Anomaly_Score = 0.8,→ PARA_A = 80
Fraud = 1,→ Risk = 1

Prediction: HIGH RISK → Trigger:

AGV to scan shipment
Email to manager
Block payment


Customise using your data.
